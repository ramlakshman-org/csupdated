  overview: [
    "A customer support agent works alongside your support team across chat, email, and voice. Unlike scripted chatbots, it uses your company's knowledge, documentation, past tickets, product data, and order systems. It understands the request, resolves it, or hands off to a human with full context.",
    "CloudSwift designs, builds, and connects this agent through integrations with your existing tools, so it behaves as an extension of your team rather than another add-on on the site. See how similar programs land in our case studies, and review pricing when you are ready to scope an engagement.",

  overview: [
    "The stage of deploying an AI model is when a trained AI or machine learning model goes from development into a real production environment. Rather than remaining only in a notebook or a test bench, the model is linked to the systems and applications that need it — whether that means real-time predictions or scheduled batch jobs.",
    "As part of an MLOps platform workflow, deployment links model development with model serving and model monitoring. At enterprise scale this means a dependable method for packaging, versioning, testing, releasing, monitoring, and rolling back models rather than a separate deployment script for each project. See case studies and pricing when you are ready to scope an engagement.",
    "CloudSwift’s AI Model Deployment service sits in our MLOps practice. Teams that also ship assistants on top of a live model often pair this work with our Customer Support Agents or Enterprise Knowledge Base Agents. Read from notebook to production (blog) if the harder problem is the operating model, not a single endpoint.",

    "Deployment is closely related to both model serving and model monitoring, but the three are not identical. Model serving is the runtime that hosts the model and handles prediction requests. Model monitoring watches what happens after go-live — performance, latency, and data drift. Deployment is what first gets the model into that operational environment. Cloud providers document the same split in Azure Machine Learning deployment, Amazon SageMaker model deployment, and Vertex AI predictions.",
