  overview: [
    "Ask any HR team what eats their week, and a chunk of the answer is the same handful of questions — how many PTO days are left, when open enrollment starts, what the policy is on X. An AI HR assistant, often called an HR chatbot, catches those questions before they land on a person's desk.",
    "It gives employees instant answers around the clock, and it gives HR back the time they used to spend answering the same thing again. CloudSwift configures the assistant on your policies and HRIS, with escalation to a real person when the question is sensitive or the answer is not certain.",
    "Teams that also need a customer-facing front door often pair this with our Customer Support Agents. Internal documentation questions that go beyond HR policy sit with Enterprise Knowledge Base Agents.",

  definition: [
    "An AI HR assistant is a chat-based tool that uses AI to answer employee questions about HR topics: PTO balances, benefits, company policy, onboarding steps, and more.",
    "It is functionally very close to an HR chatbot; the terms are used almost interchangeably. “Assistant” sometimes implies more than answering — kicking off an onboarding workflow or routing a request. An AI assistant still keeps a human owning policy. An AI agent implies more autonomous action. Most HR tools in this space today are assistants.",
    "The core idea is HR self-service: a front door for employees, and time back for HR. An AI recruiting assistant is a separate category — candidate screening and hiring, not ongoing employee support.",

    {
      q: "What is the best AI tool for HR?",
      a: "The right tool depends on your HRIS, team size, and how much of the work you want automated, ranging from HRIS-native assistants to standalone chatbot platforms.",
    },

      q: "Does an AI HR assistant integrate with my existing HRIS?",
      a: "Most AI HR assistants integrate with major HRIS and benefits platforms, either natively or through a connected tool.",

    {
      q: "Can an AI HR assistant help with employee onboarding?",
      a: "Yes. Many AI HR assistants guide new hires through common first-week questions and can trigger onboarding workflow steps automatically.",
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between an AI HR assistant and an AI recruiting assistant?",

      q: "What happens if the AI HR assistant can't answer a question?",
      a: "It routes the question to the appropriate HR team member, so the assistant handles what it can and escalates the rest.",
    },
    {

    },
    {
      q: "Can an AI HR assistant handle sensitive employee situations?",
      a: "No. Sensitive matters like investigations should always be routed to a human HR team member. The assistant is designed for routine, policy-based questions.",
    },
    {
      q: "What role does human review play in an AI HR assistant?",
      a: "Human review covers escalated questions, periodic audits of assistant answers, and ownership of the underlying policy content. The assistant handles volume; HR retains judgment and accountability.",
