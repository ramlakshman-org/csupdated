  overview: [
    "Every business runs on documents. Invoices, contracts, claims forms, ID documents, applications — and somewhere along the line, most of that information still gets typed in by hand. Document intelligence, also known as intelligent document processing, is what changes that.",
    "It uses AI to read a document, work out what kind of document it actually is, pull the specific fields that matter, and double-check that what it extracted actually makes sense before any of it touches your systems of record.",
    "This is not locked to one cloud vendor's product. It is a platform-agnostic way of solving the same underlying problem, whatever tools end up doing the work underneath. Related work: AI Workflow Automation, Enterprise Chatbots, AI Model Deployment.",

  definition: [
    "Document intelligence is AI that automatically classifies, extracts, and validates data from documents — and it goes well past what basic OCR ever did.",
    "OCR just turns an image of text into machine-readable text; it has zero idea what it is actually looking at. Document AI and intelligent document processing take it further. They recognize the document type — an invoice versus a contract versus a claims form — pull out whichever fields matter for that type, and flag anything that looks off before anyone trusts it.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What is document intelligence?",
      a: "Document intelligence is the use of AI to automatically classify, extract, and validate data from documents, turning unstructured content into structured, usable data.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is intelligent document processing?",
      a: "Intelligent document processing, often abbreviated IDP, is essentially the same concept as document intelligence, using AI to read, classify, and extract data from documents automatically.",
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between intelligent document processing and automated document processing?",
      a: "Automated document processing is the broader umbrella including rule-based systems; intelligent document processing specifically uses AI to classify and understand documents, handling variation far better than fixed-rule automation.",
    },
    {
      q: "What are the challenges of implementing intelligent document processing?",
      a: "Common challenges include handling variable or poor-quality documents, achieving trustworthy extraction accuracy, integrating with legacy systems, and the upfront work of training models against specific document types.",
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between OCR and intelligent document processing?",
      a: "OCR converts an image of text into machine-readable text without understanding the document; intelligent document processing classifies the document type, extracts relevant fields, and validates the extracted data.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is document AI?",
      a: "Document AI refers to the broader field of using artificial intelligence, including OCR, machine learning, and NLP, to read, interpret, and extract information from documents.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is this the same as Azure Document Intelligence or Google Document AI?",
      a: "No, this service is platform-agnostic and can use Azure, Google, AWS, open-source, or custom extraction models depending on what fits the documents best.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the best intelligent document processing software?",
      a: "The right choice depends on document types and volume, with cloud-native tools working well for standardized documents and specialist platforms often handling complex or varied sets better.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can document intelligence handle handwritten documents?",
      a: "Modern document intelligence tools can extract handwritten text with reasonable accuracy, though results vary more than typed text, making validation especially important.",
    },
    {
      q: "How accurate is automated document data extraction?",
      a: "Accuracy depends on document quality and consistency, with well-trained models on standardized documents commonly reaching high accuracy and validation rules catching most remaining errors.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does document intelligence work with scanned or low-quality documents?",
      a: "Yes, though accuracy generally improves with cleaner scans, and most modern platforms include preprocessing steps to improve extraction from lower-quality scans.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is document intelligence different from a document management system?",
      a: "A document management system stores and organizes documents, while document intelligence extracts and structures the data inside them, and the two are often used together.",
    },
    {
      q: "What document types can document intelligence process?",
      a: "Common types include invoices, contracts, claims forms, identity documents, receipts, tax forms, and other structured or semi-structured business documents.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does it take to set up a document intelligence pipeline?",
      a: "Timelines vary based on document variety and volume, but a focused pipeline for one high-volume document type can often go live within a few weeks.",
